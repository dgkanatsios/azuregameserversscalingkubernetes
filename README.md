# Scaling multiplayer Dedicated Game Servers on Azure Kubernetes Service

Scaling Dedicated Game Servers (DGS) is a hard problem. They're stateful (having the bulk of player data stored in server memory), can't be explicitly shut down (since players might be still enjoying their game) and, as a rule of thumb, their connection with the players must be of minimal latency, especially for real-time multiplayer games.

This repository aims to provide a solution/guidance/building blocks for managing containerized dedicated game servers using the [Kubernetes](https://k8s.io) orchestrator on Azure using the managed [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/). However, you could probably use parts of the project to scale memory-stateful workloads.

### Demos

In order to demonstrate this project, we've built a simple "echo" UDP server in Node.js and we've also adapted the [OpenArena](http://openarena.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page) open source game so it can work with our solution. Both Dockerfiles are stored in the `demos` folder whereas the corresponding Kubernetes deployment YAML files are located in the `artifacts/examples` folder.

### Thanks

To [Brian Peek](https://github.com/BrianPeek) and [Andreas Pohl](https://twitter.com/annonator) for the countless discussions we had (and still have!) about scaling DGSs. Moreover, I'd like to express my gratitude to the awesome people on *#sig-api-machinery* channel on [Kubernetes Slack](http://slack.k8s.io/) for answering a lot of my questions during the development of this project.
